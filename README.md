# BookLibrary App

## Overview
The **BookLibrary App** is a React Native application that allows users to explore and borrow books. It includes three screens:

1. **Book List Screen**: Displays a list of books fetched from Firebase. 

2. **Book Details Screen**: Shows detailed information about the selected book and allows borrowing the book from this screen, with a limit of three books at a time.

3. **Borrowed Books Screen**: Lists all books currently borrowed by the user and allows returning them from this screen.

The app uses **React Navigation** for seamless navigation between screens and **Firebase** as the backend to manage book data.
